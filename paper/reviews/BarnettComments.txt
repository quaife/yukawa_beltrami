Reviewers' comments:

Dear Dr Quaife,

Based on the reviews, we will accept your article but only after
certain revisions,
namely to fix some of the very good points raised by reviewer #1.
Review #1 is attached, and Review #2 pasted below.

I would suggest the following:
* read the Mitrea-Taylor work, and explain that your proofs are not
new, rather already covered by them,
if you agree (I looked at Mitrea and it seems to have all the theory
needed, but you will have to point to the relevant theorems). Cut
such proofs or move to appendix; state whatever you keep are given
for convenience.
* while the <10 pages requested may be unrealistic, the paper
should be a bit shorter, and cutting early proofs (or the growing k
study) is a way to do this.
* Items 1,3,4,5 of reviewer #1 are important to fix.
* Item 3 is a bit unclear to me, but I think what is being asked is
to justify that Alpert's log correction will give high-order
accuracy. This is more than just proving the DLP kernel is in C^1.
Rather, it would
involve showing the kernel is of the form f(s,t) + log|s-t| g(s,t)
where f,g are C^infty or analytic.
It seems, by analogy with the Helmholtz case, this is probably true
(for the DLP then g(s,s) = (d/dt) g(s,t)|_{t=s} = 0, ie the leading
singularity in the kernel is (s-t)^2 log|s-t| ). At least some
discussion to address this, or a proof if you have one, is needed.
* Reviewer #2 finds the notation re separatrix unclear, so this is
important to fix.

We usually give 90 days for this. Yours sincerely,      Alex
Barnett, editorial board.


Reviewer #2:
I have read the paper ``Integral equation methods for the
Yukawa-Beltrami equation on the sphere'' by M. C. Kropinski, N.
Nigam,
and B. Quaife.  This is an excellent and timely paper that no doubt
should be published in Advances in Computational Mathematics. The
paper introduces a closed form of a fundamental solution for the
Yukawa-Beltrami equation on a unit sphere thus extending classical
results for the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

The paper is well-written, and it pleasure to read. My only
suggestion
has to do with the confusing terminology. A parametrix is usually
just
an approximation to a fundamental solution of a partial differential
equation, [1]. In this paper, the terms ``parametrix'' and
``fundamental solution'' are used somewhat interchangeably, e.g.,
Proposition 1 indicates that $G_k$ is a fundamental solution, but it
is referred to as a parametrix in Section 3. The authors might want
to
clarify their choice - obviously, strictly at the authors'
discretion. We would also like to point out that similar techniques
have been used to derive fundamental solutions for toroidal
geometries, [2]-[3], and in describing Yukawa scattering, [4].

To summarize, this is an excellent paper, very much acceptable for
publication in ACOM. It requires no further revision.
